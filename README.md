The Practical Linux Hardening Guide provides a high-level overview of hardening GNU/Linux systems. It is not an official standard or handbook but it touches and uses industry standards.

This guide also provides you with practical step-by-step instructions for building your own hardened systems and services. One of the main goals is to create a single document covering internal and external threats.

A few rules for this project:

useful, simple, and not tiring
include a lot of security tips from the C2S/CIS
contains also non-related rules with C2S/CIS
based on a minimal RHEL7 and CentOS 7 installations
it's not exhaustive about Linux hardening
some hardening rules/descriptions can be done better
you can think of it as a checklist
The Practical Linux Hardening Guide use following OpenSCAP configurations:

U.S. Government Commercial Cloud Services (C2S) baseline inspired by CIS v2.1.1

C2S for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 v0.1.43.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG)

The requirements are derived from the (NIST) 800-53 and related documents.

Please also remember:

This guide contains my comments that may differ from certain industry principles. If you are not sure what to do please see Policy Compliance.

The Importance of Hardening Linux
Simply speaking, hardening is the process of making a system more secure. Out of the box, Linux servers don’t come "hardened" (e.g. with the attack surface minimized). It’s up to you to prepare for each eventuality and set up systems to notify you of any suspicious activity in the future.

The process of hardening servers involves both IT ops. and security teams and require changes to the default configuration according to industry benchmarks.
